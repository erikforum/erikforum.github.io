<p>If you can read Chinese, please do so. I will translate the above paragraphs for those cannot speak Chinese. My English ability is limited, but I will do my best to translate.</p>
<p>Chinese Internet:<br>Not only China, internet censorship widely exist in all over the world. When the global situation is not benefiting China, the authorities will censor the information that will damage the long-term development of China. In that situation, the top priority is to make sure the safe of the country.</p>
<p>There are unrealistic, subjective even self-contradictory information that blacken the authorities. Normally, they are supported by west government or NGOs. These media including but not limited to some Hong Kong and abroad media.</p>
<p>We hope that when you encounter those information and statements, do not believe them without thinking, believe them because your emotion were aroused, believe those biased, distorting information. Instead, encounter it with a critical thinking mind. Think about the information, not the opinion.</p>
<p>We need to understand that Chinese idea for development is advancing steadily. Chinese society’s core is steady. If China lose its steady, it will be a heap of loose sand, facing the danger of collapsing. We want you to understand that what is the basic guarantee for Chinese development, what is the main theme when developing and what is the noises and backward ideas when developing.</p>
<p>We should be clear and look at the question comprehensively. Believing western medias’ statement at the same time of losing faith in our own country is inadvisable. Your data security and privacy is highly important for you. When the data should not be obtained by the west, it is more important to the fate of the country and the nation. Because of this, the authorities will limit your action, we won’t and we can intervene the decisions made by the authorities.</p>
<p>Therefore, we want you to not attack the authorities when using this service.</p>
<p>This is a website that provides service to visit sites like google and Facebook. However, this explanation for the censorship has convinced my since the first time I read it.</p>
<p>I’m a patriot. But I’m not a typical patriot. I will not crush japan-made cars when others will do so. I think about the causes of their action. When it comes to this situation, I have faith in my country. I believe that when the public cannot tell apart the truth and the lies, the authorities have the necessity to block some of the information to let us stay united.</p>
